The webpage is also live at www.diweeb.com/login/login.html.

The site has both a light and dark mode, which changes depending on the system preferences using media queries.
The site is not responsive, though it does not look too terrible on a mobile browser. It just needs to be zoomed in a bit to be useful.

No backend has been created, and all the links redirect to self.
